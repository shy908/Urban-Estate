    <p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
        As I started my journey at Holberton School in the early spring of 2022, I discovered that I was in the middle of a hard but very gratifying coding bootcamp. 
        The coursework was rigorous, and the coding assignments were really difficult. 
        A spark of inspiration, however, burned within me amid all the lines of code and debugging sessions, inspiring me to create my interior design blog website project.
        <br>
        I've always had a sharp eye for design and aesthetics.
        I began to wonder how I could mix my love of interior design with my newfound coding talents as the months at Holberton passed. 
        I came to the conclusion that starting an interior design blog website would be the ideal platform for me to showcase my creativity and impart knowledge to others.
        The project's schedule took form. I spent my weekends and evenings polishing my web programming abilities, researching content management systems, and experimenting with various design styles. 
        I drew out my blog's design, including the layout, colour scheme, and even the logo that would stand in for my brand, slowly but surely.
        I also got in touch with other of my Holberton School classmates who were enthusiastic about web design and development. 
        We came together as a tight-knit group and started this creative project. We were aware that this project would be both a showcase for our developing skills and a way for us to express ourselves personally in terms of design.
        We worked closely together throughout the whole development process, utilising the distinct talents of each team member.
        We put forth a lot of effort to make sure that the blog accurately represented our passion for interior design in every way, including the frontend and backend coding and content curation.
